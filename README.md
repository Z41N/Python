# Hey everyone! Zain here - 

Here's a glimpse into all of the beginner-level projects using Python 3.7. 

I know that my coding skills require some work, but everyone starts somewhere. Given my passion to want to learn and grow in this industry/field, I figure I do it RIGHT with books, classes, and GITHUB (which is why you'll see some of my .py files in this repository). I've made it a point to use comments as much as possible, to really reiterate and drill-in some concepts, for my present and future self.

The main purpose of this is to not only track my work, but begin a portfolio so that potential employers can take a look at what I am doing and where I am headed. As someone with management, IT, and healthcare experience, I do believe I am a great fit for many positions; however, my passion is wanting to program so that's what I'm working towards - and I'm HUNGRY FOR IT! 

If you'd like to have an open discussion about potential roles, or even just chat, please email me and we can setup a time:

Thanks for the visit, and I wish everyone the absolute best!!

Zain
