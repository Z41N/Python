# Hey everyone! Zain here - 

Started learning Python and SQL back in July/Aug 2019. 
Landed an analyst job in Sept 2019, but it was heavily-dependant on SQL and Tableau only. 
COVID hit in March 2020, and I lost my job. 

Now, I'm taking the opportunity to develop my Python skills. 
Not just with syntax, functions, classes, and all these fundamentals but also on best practices (documentation, formatting, readability, Time/Space complexities, etc.). 

Shoot me an email if you want to get in touch:

Feedback and criticism is strongly welcomed :)
